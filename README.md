Scalability and Performance: Kafka is designed to be highly scalable and offers high throughput and low latency. It can handle millions of messages per second and is used by many organizations for real-time data processing and analytics.


Offset: Each record within a partition is assigned a unique sequential identifier called an offset. Offsets are used by consumers to track their position in the partition and to resume consumption from where they left off in case of failure or restart.


Jay Kreps chose to name the software after the author Franz Kafka because it is "a system optimized for writing", and he liked Kafka's work.
